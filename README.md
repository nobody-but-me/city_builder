A very tiny and cute toy city builder written with TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS and PostgreSQL.

## Run 

The best way to run this game in your local machine is using the development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Then you just have to open the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) address in your favorite browser.
